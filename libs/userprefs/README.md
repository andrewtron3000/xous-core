# Xous user preference

Instead of having device settings sparse across the operating system UX, I propose we unify everything under a single umbrealla: a `Preferences` applet.

This would relieve `status` of the burden of having random stuff filed under its menu and streamline the codebase a little bit.

## Interesting toggles 

- [x] Turn on Wi-Fi subsystem on boot
- [x] Connect to known networks on boot
- [x] Default backlight state
- [x] (With autobacklight on) Backlight timeout
- [ ] Keyboard layout
- [ ] Timezone
- [ ] Date/time
- [ ] Speaker volume
- [ ] Wi-Fi submenu
